# API Tests

In this repository I added some screenshots from Postman, tool that I used for API testing.


First example of an [API test](http://qachallenge.ro/api/) is inserting new data in a form.

Another tested API is https://api.chucknorris.io/. Example below shows a test by free text search:

Below is an example of API test using multiple parameters: search, type and year. Tested API can be found [here.](https://www.omdbapi.com/)
